About Me
Hi there! I'm Macowen Keru, a passionate and dedicated software developer based in Kirinyaga, Kenya. Currently, I'm pursuing my Certificate in Software Development at the Inceptor Institute of Technology in Nairobi, where I am honing my skills in web development and design.

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities of technology and how it can transform our world. I have a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in various modern frameworks such as React and Laravel. My technical toolkit also includes expertise in PHP, MySQL, Sass, and Bootstrap, which I use to build dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

What Drives Me
My journey in software development is driven by a genuine love for problem-solving and a constant desire to learn and grow. Whether it's creating a sleek e-commerce platform, developing a social media application, or building a comprehensive content management system, I thrive on tackling challenging projects and delivering high-quality solutions.

Looking Ahead
As I approach my graduation in July 2024, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue to grow as a developer.
